# GenerativeArt
A dumping ground for the start of my work into investigating using algortihms to make Art. Currently there exists a very simple example in both Processing and P5 which I intended to use for a talk. There is also a slighty more complex version I have been playing around with. 

Nothing too exciting, please feel free to improve, edit and update.
